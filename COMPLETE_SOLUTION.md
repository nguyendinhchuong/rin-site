## 📖 How It All Works

### Development Workflow
```
1. Edit code/content
   ↓
2. pnpm dev (hot reload)
   ↓
3. Test locally at localhost:4321
   ↓
4. pnpm build (verify it builds)
   ↓
5. pnpm preview (optional - test production)
   ↓
6. git push (deploy to Vercel)
```

### Production Behavior
```
User visits page
   ↓
Is cached? → YES → Serve instantly
   ↓ NO
Fetch from Sanity
   ↓
Generate page
   ↓
Cache for 1 hour
   ↓
Serve to user
```

### Content Update Flow
```
Editor updates Sanity
   ↓
Webhook fires (optional)
   ↓
Cache marked stale
   ↓
Next visitor triggers regeneration
   ↓
Fresh content cached
```
